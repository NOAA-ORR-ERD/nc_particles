# Format for particle tracking files in netCDF

This project seeks to define a standardized format for sharing the results of particle tracking models.

It was designed with oil spill models in mind, but should support othe particle tracking applications.

[The standard is here: ](nc_particle_standard.md)

The development of the standardis being mananged in a gitHub project:

Please add issues to that project with questions and suggestions.
